        <h2>Our Destination</h2>
        
        <p>With the Mars Mission dream coming closer to fruition, it's important that you know all the in's and out's of the the beautiful "Red Planet". Of course, the finalists chosen to embark on this journey will all be taught and expected to know just about all that Mars has to offer, but here's some of the highlights.</p>
        
        <h3>Discovery</h3>
        
        <p>Mars was discovered by Egyptian astronomers during the 2nd millennium BC, but most people are more familiar with Gelileo Galilei's observation of Mars in 1610. Around this time, astronomers were able to determine its axial tilt and the planet's rotation period, but were not extremely accurate due to the less-than-preferred technology.</p>
        
        <h3>Study</h3>
        
        <p>Early 19th century technology allowed us to get a much better look at the giant red beast. We were able to make more detailed maps, going into more vivid detail by the 1870s. This was also when astronomers mistakenly stated that Mars had water in its atmosphere and the idea of life on Mars started spreading. The spreading rumors were later proved to be false--Mars' atmosphere was found to be too thin to support life like Earth. During the 1920s, Mars was determined to have a surface temperature ranging between -121 to 45 degrees Fahrenheit, and the the atmosphere was found to be very arid, lacking oxygen and water. </p>
        
        <h3>Recent Findings</h3>
        
        <p>Robots and spacecraft have been sent to gather information for us to study as our technology skyrockets. These machines have given us a plethora of good news, including the one that drove the public mad: Mars is habitable! Our astronomical and technological advancements make it possible for us to send humans into space and to their new home. </p>
        
        <p>Let the journey begin.</p>
